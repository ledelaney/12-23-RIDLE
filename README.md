## Slides

Libraries and preliminary `HTML` file created with the R package `xaringan`, built on `remark.js`. The rest was (poorly) hard-coded the old-fashioned way.

### Images

Originate from [RawPixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/category/53/public-domain), an incredible resource of public domain images. (Found trawling the GitHub pages of [@apreshill](https://github.com/apreshill).) Many were modified later in Illustrator.
